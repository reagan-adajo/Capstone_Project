## PHASE 5 CAPSTONE PROJECT PROPOSAL
## Fake News Detection 

**What is Fake News Detection?** 

Fake news detection in ML involves using algorithms to classify news articles as either real or fake based on linguistic patterns, source credibility, and other features. Models are trained on labeled datasets to identify misleading or false information. Common techniques include:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzing text structure, sentiment, and writing style.
- **Supervised Learning**: Training classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, LSTMs) using labeled datasets.
- **Deep Learning & Transformers**: Using models like BERT for context-aware detection.
